##Fizzbuzz##

The following repository contains a program called "fizzbuzz" that prints the integers from 1 to 100. BUT, if the integer is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. If the integer is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

####SETUP####

######C######

Copy the source file into your favourite directory (any one will do). Open terminal and cd to the appropriate directory. Once you are in the respective directory, compile the C program using your favourite C compiler. For example, using gcc it would look like this:

     	 gcc -o fizzbuzz fizzbuzz.c

Then, run the program with the following command:

      	  ./fizzbuzz

######Java######

Copy the source	file into your favourite directory (any	one will do). Open terminal and cd to the appropriate directory. Once you are in the respective directory, compile the Java program using the Java compiler. The command should look like this:

     	 javac Fizzbuzz.java

Then, run the program with the following command:

      	 java Fizzbuzz

You may also use your own IDE of preference to run the program as well.
